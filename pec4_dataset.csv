I take this opportunity to remind you that we still have not concluded the task started in Dayton, Ohio of interpreting certain regulations contained in the Transit Agreement for Peace Plan Operations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and NATO, signed on 21 and 23 November 1995. On 20 February 1996, we received a letter from Mr. B. de Vidts, Legal Adviser of NATO, which contained some interpretations of the provisions of the Transit Agreement, but these interpretations greatly departed from those agreed upon in Dayton. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Transit Agreement is subject to the approval by the Federal Assembly. Pending the approval, it is implemented on a temporary basis. In my previous letters I explained to you that your confirmation as to the meaning of certain regulations contained in the Transit Agreement, set forth in Dayton, would be of great importance in the procedure of granting the approval to the Transit Agreement by the Federal Assembly. In his letter of 30 April 1996, General George Joulwan (SACEUR) informed me that the matter would be reviewed by the competent officials and that I would shortly be informed thereof. Since I have not received any reply so far, I kindly ask you to intercede so that the competent NATO authorities may confirm in a letter the interpretation of the Transit Agreement agreed upon in Dayton. I am sending you, enclosed herewith, a copy of the text ""Understandings Regarding Certain Provisions of the Agreement Between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Concerning Transit Arrangements for Peace Plan Operations"", set forth in Dayton...

The Republic of Croatia, as a co-signatory of the Dayton/Paris Agreement, has been supporting the implementation of its provisions throughout the previous period in the interest of stability and security in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the role of IFOR in carrying out the military measures designed to ensure peace.

We acknowledge that under the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are committed to creating police organisations, predicated on the advice of the Commisioner [sic] of the United Nations International Police Task Force (UN IPTF), that are structured and operate according to generally accepted international standards for policing and guarantee respect for internationally accepted human rights.";BIH;;398;;215.0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We reiterate our strong commitment to the speedy implementation and full functioning of the Federation and all its institutions. We reaffirm our commitment to the Dayton Agreement on Implementing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 10 November 1995 and to the obligations of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina of 14 December 1995. We confirm our support for the Rome Statement of 18 February 1996, the Geneva Statement of 18 March 1996 and the Sarajevo Agreement on the Federation of 30 March 1996.

We reiterate our commitment with regard to the provisions of the Peace Agreement that all refugees and displaced persons have the right to return to their homes in the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with full protection of their human and other rights.

Page 2, Federation implementation, 9. 
We reaffirm the commitment under the Rome Statement on Sarajevo of 18 February 1996 that there will be equal treatment and non-discrimination for Bosniacs, Croats, Serbs and Others in Sarajevo. This includes, in line with paragraph 7 above, the right of return for refugees and displaced persons of all peoples that left Sarajevo and the full protection of their human and other rights. It also means that all these peoples will have the opportunity to participate fully in the governance of the city. The Joint Civilian Commission Sarajevo will continue to function, as stipulated in the Rome Statement, as a consultative and coordinating body for this purpose.

Page 4, Media issues, 18. 
After consideration of the implementation of previous agreements on the Federation, we stress the importance of realizing the provisions on media contained in the Petersberg Agreement of 10 March 1995. With this in mind, the President and the Vice President of the Federation will submit this issue to the Federation Assembly, with a view to ensuring free access of all citizens and peoples to the public media.

Page 4, Police issues, 19. 
We support the Agreement on restructuring the police of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina concluded in Bonn-Petersberg today; we also welcome that the inaugural session of the Police Commission responsible for the implementation of the Agreement took place here today.

Page 4, Police issues, 21. 
We welcome the presentation of the newly designed grey Federation police uniforms today in Bonn-Petersberg that will be used by all uniformed police operating throughout the Federation, as has been decided by the Federation Government. This uniform is an important symbol of our commitment to the restructuring of policing in the Federation.

Page 5, Economic issues, 26. 
We note that the World Bank supports the building up of key economic institutions of the Federation, as agreed in paragraph 7 of the Sarajevo Agreement on the Federation, i.e.:
- the Federation customs administration is fully operational (all Federation revenue accounts are open, and uninterrupted transfer of customs revenue into these accounts takes place and proper monitoring and control of all international border crossing is assured, in accordance with the Sarajevo Agreement);

The Conference agrees that the peace should result in:...(h) Successful implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium;

Page 2-3, Military implementation 8.
The military mission was described as having the following primary tasks: (a) To ensure continued compliance with the Cessation-of-Hostilities Agreement;

General Joulwan said that, in addition to these key tasks, IFOR might be asked to undertake the following supporting tasks within the limits of its capabilities: (a) To help create secure conditions for the conduct by others of other tasks associated with the Peace Agreement (though IFOR would not undertake humanitarian tasks itself);

Page 3, Regional stabilization, 12.

The Conference concludes that, with the signature of the Peace Agreement, important objectives of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia have been met and a new structure is required to manage peace implementation.

Page 6, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 23. 
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has involved great suffering among the civilian population. Over 2.1 million people have been displaced or become refugees. The Conference acknowledges the great contribution made during the conflict by UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, funded in large part by EU, as well as the support given in the countries of asylum. It agrees that an early objective of the Peace Agreement is to create secure conditions for the safe and orderly return of refugees and displaced persons to places of their choice.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 25.
The President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drew attention to the Committee’s tasks in respect of prisoners and missing persons. Fulfilment of the Peace Agreement will require: ...(b) Full cooperation of the parties over the release of prisoners and the provision of information about the fate of persons unaccounted for, as set out in the Peace Agreement.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 27. 
The parties undertake to comply urgently and fully with their obligations in creating the conditions necessary for the early, safe and orderly return of refugees and to cooperate fully with ICRC to ensure the early release of prisoners in accordance with the Peace Agreement.

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 32. 
The Conference decides that, in view of the human rights situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, urgent action is needed in the following areas:...(c) OSCE should appoint an ombudsman, as provided for in the Peace Agreement; (d) The relevant Council of Europe organs should appoint members of the constitutional court for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the human rights chamber, as provided for in the Peace Agreement;

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 33.

Page 8, Elections, 34. 
The Conference notes that, between six and nine months after signature of the Peace Agreement, elections supervised by a provisional election commission established by OSCE will be held in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These elections are of paramount importance in bringing about a democratic and stable country.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 46. 
An informal meeting involving a number of delegations closely concerned was held in the margins of the Conference to discuss the implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 47. 
There was recognition of the crucial importance of successful implementation of this Agreement. The international community will play its part. The United Nations Secretary-General will issue a report by 14 December.

The choice of the itinerary will be left to the organisations in charge of the delivery of aid in consulatation with UNPROFOR and this in function of the military situation, agreements concluded in the field, the climate and the condition of the routes.

The European Union is perfectly aware of the validity of the claims of Croatia and of the support that it is entitled to expect from the international community for the full implementation of the Vance Plan. For lack of a rapid final solution, the European Union will concentrate on the adoption of a modus vivendi comprising a ceasefire and confidence-building measures in conformity with Resolution 847 of the Security Council.

Sealing borders. We note the pledge of the Belgrade authorities to close the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Peace Plan. We are watching to see if the border closure is effective. Although the primary responsibility for enforcing this step belongs to Belgrade, we can assist, for instance by placing monitors on the borders or providing technical expertise or conducting aerial surveillance. We also note the willingness expressed by the Zagreb authorities for monitoring to take place along the border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

In connection with the renewal of the conflicts between the two armies (the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council) in central Bosnia and some other parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have caused many casualties and serious violations of international humanitarian law, thus posing the threat of far-reaching political consequences, the signatories of this Joint Statement hereby order all military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to immediately cease fire and all hostilities in all areas where such military units are in contact.

Page 1, 3. 
The signatories of this Joint Statement urge all commanders and units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to unconditionally respect all the thus far concluded agreements between the representatives of the Croatian and Muslim peoples in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In particular, they urge military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council to immediately start implementing the Agreement on the legality of both the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the HVO, and on the establishment of a joint command of both forces made up of representatives of both headquarters (enclosure).

Page 1-2, 4.
The signatories of the Joint Statement reaffirm that the conflicts between units of the HVO and of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are contrary to the policy of the representatives of the two peoples, and that the continuation of such conflicts would seriously jeopardize the achievement of their political goals, i.e. the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of the Vance-Owen plan accepted and signed by the signatories of this Statement, and success in the fight against the aggressor who wants to break the State apart, occupy its territory and annex the occupied territories to ""Greater Serbia"".

The London conference welcomes the steps taken by the international community to implement United Nations Security council Resolutions 713 and 757 imposing mandatory sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, but regrets that there remain gaps in implementation. The following proposals deal with the gaps identified so far.

Page 1, Compliance with UNSCR 757: need for enforcement, 2. 
The Conference notes that many countries are cooperating with the UN Sanctions Committee but is concerned that compliance remains incomplete. The Conference calls on all governments forthwith to comply fully with the requirements of UNSCR 757. All governments should respond to the appeal issued by the UN Sanctions Committee for information regarding violations of the sanctions regime.

Page 1, Compliance with UNSCR 757: need for enforcement, 3.
The Conference recommends that the Security Council should consider any requests made to it under Article 50 of the UN Charter by any state which considers that it is confronted by special economic problems arising from carrying out the requirements of UNSCR 757.

Page 2, The Danube, 5.
The Conference notes that Article 103 of the UN Charter obliges the riparian states of the Danube to do whatever is necessary, including the stopping and searching of vessels, to prevent the use of the River Danube for the purposes of circumventing or breaking the sanctions imposed in UNSCR Resolutions 713 and 757, notwithstanding the provisions of the Belgrade Convention.

Page 2, Unauthorised transfers of Serbian and Montenegrin assets, 7. 
The Conference is concerned that financial transfers for the benefit of Serbia and Montenegro in breach of UNSCR 757 are taking place. The Conference countries reaffirm their commitment to prevent such transfers and call on other states to do the same. The conference invites the UN  Sanctions Committee to consider whether its guidelines need to be tightened for this purpose.

Page 2, Strengthening the legal framework, 9. 
The Conference invites the Security Council to take such further measures as may be necessary to ensure the full implementation of UNSCRs 713 and 757. Existing sanctions are possibly being breached by maritime traffic in the Adriatic Sea. The Security council is therefore invited to consider further measures to ensure rigorous implementation of sanctions in the Adriatic.";BIH;;389;;215.0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Although the group will focus on new measures, it will also be important to ensure that existing obligations under the terms at the Vienna Document 92 in respect of provision of information are fully implemented.

…
Recalling that the Ouagadougou Political Agreement was endorsed by the Economic 
Community of West African States, the African Union and the United Nations, 
Aware of the need to complete successfully the peace process initiated by the Ouagadougou Political Agreement and previous agreements, 
Determined fully to meet the commitments made under the Ouagadougou Political Agreement of 4 March 2007 and the supplementary agreements thereto and to bring about the reunification of the country in order to establish favourable conditions for the elections,

…
The Forces nouvelles should also transmit to the Facilitator, for the CCI, the list of the 600 individuals who, under the Pretoria Agreement, will be deployed immediately alongside the National Police and the National Gendarmerie under the command of the CCI. At the end of the crisis recovery process, they shall be incorporated into the National Police and the National Gendarmerie. The State budget shall cover their expenses. 

Page 3, Article 7
The two parties have decided to resolve the issue of the ranks of FAFN soldiers who are former members of the Defence and Security Forces (FDS) as follows:
-	The two general officers of the Forces nouvelles shall be assigned the rank of brigadier general by presidential decree as from the date of adoption of the Amnesty Law of 12 April 2007
…
-	The soldiers recruited under class 2001/1A for training and incorporation into the army who are currently in the FAFN ranks shall be hired by the FDS under the Amnesty Law of 12 April 2007 and incorporated into the new national army

Page 4, Article 8

We also gladly note that this process has to date enabled plans for a Trade and Navigation Treaty, for Navigation in the Gaps in Rivers and in the Napo River, for a Comprehensive Border Integration Agreement, and for the constitution of a Binational Commission on Mutual Trust and Safety Measures, as well as for an agreement for establishing measures to ensure the effective functioning of the Zarumilla Channel. 

Page 1, Par. 4:
Your Government has, together with the Government of Ecuador, conveyed to us its concern for having tried, throughout this long process and without achieving results that meet the expectations of both populations, to cover all aspects, as described by the Brasilia Declaration of November 26th, 1997, and the Rio de Janeiro Timetable on January 19th of the current year. As Your Excellency mentioned in the letter that was jointly sent with the President of Ecuador on the 8th of this month (October) to the President of Brazil, the difficulties encountered have to do with setting a Common Land Border in the area. 

Page 2, Par. 1: 
Accordingly, having complied with these requirements, we, Heads of State of the Guarantor Countries, in line with the Santiago Agreement and the Rio de Janeiro Timetable, express our point of view (which the parties accept as being of a binding nature), that contains the following elements to complete the establishment of a Common Land Border in the area and complement the comprehensive and definitive agreement

Page 2, Art.1:
1. In light of disagreement between the parties on  the views and opinions issued by the experts appointed by the Guarantor Countries, in line with the Brasilia Declaration timetable on the three items submitted for consideration, the Guarantor Countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol believe that such views are part of the implementation of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol and under the judgment of the Arbitrator Braz Dias de Aguiar, and that the parties must therefore proceed to finalize these borders in the manner established by these views and opinions. For this purpose, the annexed maps specify the coordinates of the landmarks to be erected

Page 3, Art.11:
11. Additionally, the parties will proceed to formalize projects put in place by the treaties and agreements, the texts of which are part of the comprehensive and definitive agreement that will put an end to the differences between the two countries. Moreover, we have the pleasure to inform you that, as stated in our communication of October 10th, this operation has been brought to the knowledge of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, who is pleased for this noble compromise and prays that the present agreement is the basis of a lasting coexistence in peace and prosperity of the fraternal people of Peru and Ecuador. 

Page 3, final paragraph:
The Guarantor Countries consider that the process born from the Peace Declaration of Itaramaty will be completed while respecting the interests and feelings of the two nations and ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. In this way, aspirations of peace, friendship and belief in a common future that the people of Peru and Ecuador seek may develop. ";ECU;PER;403;;217.0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0

Spanish: Acuerdo de la Reunión Tripartita";1993-09-08;Multiparty signed/agreed;9;20843;Intra;Imp;ExtSub;;"Page 1, Untitled Preamble
In recent weeks, a series of bilateral meetings have taken place in an attempt to find solutions to outstanding issues for compliance with the agreements based on the document presented by the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional, FMLN) to the Security Council and Secretary General on 16 July, setting out what are in its opinion 15 priority outstanding points to be implemented by the Government of El Salvador, to which a further four were added.
The review and search for solutions to these points, with which the government explicitly indicated its desire to comply, was bearing fruit. However, in some instances there remains much work to be done, as is the case with the Land Transfer Programme, which has currently only reached around 10% of the planned target. In others, legislative decrees are required and are currently pending approval by the Legislative Assembly, while other points are currently being implemented. Finally, some points have required decisive government action, while others have simply been implemented.
Following this exercise, both parties agreed that points that have already been dealt with and routine matters must not be included in the meeting scheduled with the president. Instead, only those that, not being specifically covered in the agreements and whose solution can deliver progress in the peace and reconciliation process, require a political solution at the presidential level should be included. These points will be dealt with outside the agreements and will be included in Items 7 and 10 for youth veterans.

5. Guarantee the civil nature of PNC and its autonomy with respect to the Armed Forces.
... In the complementary agreements dated 22 December 1992, it was agreed, as expressed in the letters sent regarding the matter by Iqbal Riza, at the time Special Representative of the Secretary General, on 23 December 1992, that military members of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and UEA were only authorised to enter PNC based on their technical qualifications, subject to permanent separation from the armed forces and only under exceptional circumstances, without setting a precedent.
The current staff and teams of IACHR and UEA will be incorporated into PNC in this way to form the initial core of the criminal and antinarcotics investigation divisions, respectively, incorporated not as whole units, but as individual teams and staff. FMLN reiterates its position that only staff of IACHR and UEA as of 22 December 1992 can be transferred and will be assessed by the Director of PNC with verification by ONUSAL prior to joining, based on criteria of professional competence and aptitude to perform the corresponding role in the new civil police body. Following evaluation, they must also pass the specifically designed ANSP course for the doctrine and other conceptual elements of PNC, as set out in the aforementioned agreements on 22 December.

Page 7, G. FUNDING
15. Achieving the remaining funding
The government is using its own resources to meet the financial requirements derived from the agreements: it has provided SVC 36 million for the operations of ANSP, SVC 176 million for PNC and SVC 40 million for TSE. Financial support from the international community has been less than envisaged and slow in arriving.
The Secretary General of the United Nations will continue to support the government’s efforts to obtain the necessary resources.

2. Move ANSP to its permanent building.
The ANSP facilities in Comalapa have reached a high degree of satisfactory functionality, as shown by the events for the first anniversary of ANSP and the launch of the new infrastructure for its facilities in Comalapa on 7 September. As such, it is not deemed necessary to start the infrastructure works for construction of the final ANSP site due to the high cost.

... Whereas in the Oslo Agreement of 30 March 1990, the delegation of the National Reconciliation Commission of Guatemala (CNR), acting with the full support of the Government of Guatemala, and the delegation of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), acting with the full support of its General Command, placed on record their express determination to find ways to solve the nation's problems peacefully by political means,
Whereas on 24 April 1991, the process of direct negotiation began between the Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), the Parties having pledged that the political agreements reached would reflect the legitimate aspirations of all Guatemalans and would be drawn up in accordance with the constitutional framework in force and with the El Escorial agreements, in which URNG and the country's political parties had pledged to promote such reforms of the Political Constitution of the Republic as were necessary for the reconciliation of all Guatemalans, the ending of the internal armed conflict, the peaceful solution of the nation's problems by political means and full respect for and application of the law,

Page 1, I. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
... Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional, political, economic, social and ethnic issues, on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity,

Page 2, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples
4. This Agreement provides for constitutional recognition of the identity of the Maya, Garifuna and Xinca peoples and, from that standpoint, of the need to define and characterize the Guatemalan State as being one of national unity and multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual in nature. It is not just a matter of recognizing the existence and identity of various ethnic groups, as article 66 of the Constitution currently does, but of recognizing that the very make-up of society, without prejudice to the unity of the nation and the State, is characterized in that way; this also entails recognizing the specific nature of indigenous people's spirituality as an essential component of their world view and of the transmission of their values, and granting official constitutional recognition to indigenous languages as one of the mainstays of national culture and as a vehicle for acquiring and transmitting indigenous people's world view, knowledge and cultural values.

Page 3, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Identity of the Maya, Official recognition of indigenous languages
7. Sponsor in the Congress of the Republic, in accordance with the conclusions of the Official Recognition Commission established under the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the necessary constitutional amendments arising out of the Commission's work.

Page 3, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society
10. Within the framework of the modernization of State institutions, the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society provides for constitutional reforms with respect to the Congress of the Republic, the Judiciary, the functions of the President of the Republic, and the Guatemalan armed forces. The aim is not to propose case-by-case measures, but to reformulate the whole conception of State organs and institutions with a view to strengthening democracy in line with present-day constitutional trends.

Page 6, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society, Functions of the President of the Republic
24. With regard to the functions of the President of the Republic, it has been agreed to sponsor the inclusion of the following in article 183:
... ""To order these exceptional measures, the President of the Republic shall issue the corresponding agreement. The action of the armed forces shall be limited to such time and modalities as are strictly necessary and shall cease as soon as its purpose has been achieved. The President of the Republic shall keep the Congress informed of the operations of the armed forces, and the Congress may at any time order that such operations shall cease. In any event, within 15 days following the end of such operations, the President of the Republic shall submit to the Congress a detailed report on the action of the armed forces.""

Page 7-8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME
Whereas:
... The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors, including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans, the capacity of political parties to fulfil people's expectations, the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education, all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen.
... This Agreement seeks to promote legal and institutional reforms which will remedy those shortcomings and constraints and, together with the other peace agreements, help to improve the electoral regime as an instrument of democratic transformation.

It is recommended that the above Commission be constituted no later than three months after the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and that it complete its work no later than six months from the date of its establishment. In order to achieve its objectives, the Commission would have to encourage an extensive pluralistic debate on the subject of Guatemala's electoral regime.

On consideration of various demands of Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and consequent upon Tripartite Meeting held on 25.7.1988 at New Delhi between the Union Home Minister, Government of West Bengal and Shri Subash Ghisingh, President, GNLF, a Memorandum of Settlement (Darjeeling Accord) was signed on 22.8.1988. Pursuant to another meeting between the Union Home Minister and Shri Subash Ghisingh, President GNLF at New Delhi on 25.7. 1988, a further Memorandum of Settlement was signed on 23.8.1988.

Page 1,
3. Pursuant to the above mentioned Settlement, GNLF agreed to drop the demand for a separate State of Gorkhaland and an autonomous hill council, viz, Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), was set up under ‘The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Act, 1988’ notified by the Government of West Bengal on 15.10.1988. The hill areas under DGHC comprised of the three hill Sub-Divisions of Darjeeling District, viz, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong and 13 mouzas of Siliguri Sub-Division of that District.

4. However, Shri Subash Ghisingh (former Chairman and Chief Executive Councilor, DGHC, presently Administrator) had been demanding constitutional status for the DGHC as, according to him, the abovementioned Settlements could not fulfill the aspirations of the people of Darjeeling. A series of tripartite meetings were held between Government of India, Government of West Bengal and Shri Subash Ghisingh to review the implementation of Darjeeling Accord and further issues arising from it. As a result of these meetings, it is hereby agreed in principle to create a self-governing body for the Darjeeling hill areas in the State of West Bengal.";IND;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0

It is encouraging and important that, even though much remains to be done, very substantial progress has already been made in turning the promise of the Agreement into a reality. We must not forget or underplay how far we have come...

Page 14, STRAND TWO, NORTH/SOUTH MINISTERIAL COUNCIL, 10. 
The two Governments will make necessary legislative and other enabling preparations to ensure, as an absolute commitment, that these bodies, which have been agreed as a result of the work programme, function at the time of the inception of the British-Irish Agreement and the transfer of powers, with legislative authority for these bodies transferred to the Assembly as soon as possible thereafter. Other arrangements for the agreed co-operation will also commence contemporaneously with the transfer of powers to the Assembly.

Page 17, STRAND TWO, BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, 1.
There will be a new British-Irish Agreement dealing with the totality of relationships. It will establish a standing British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which will subsume both the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council and the Intergovernmental Conference established under the 1985 Agreement.

Page 17, STRAND TWO, BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, 9. 
The Conference will keep under review the workings of the new British-Irish Agreement and the machinery and institutions established under it, including a formal published review three years after the Agreement comes into effect. Representatives of the Northern Ireland Administration will be invited to express views to the Conference in this context. The Conference will contribute as appropriate to any review of the overall political agreement arising from the multi-party negotiations but will have no power to override the democratic arrangements set up by this Agreement.

Page 2, Article 3
The objective of the Commission is to facilitate the decommissioning of firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive substances (hereinafter referred to as ""arms"") in accordance with the Report of the International Body, and regulations or arrangements made under the Decommissioning Act, 1997 and any decommissioning schemes within the meaning of section 1 of the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997.";GBR;IRL;315;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

In their Joint Communique of 28 February 1996, the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach confirmed that all-party negotiations will be convened on Monday 10 June 1996 following intensive consultations with the relevant political parties and the completion of a broadly acceptable elective process. This paper sets out proposals drawn up by the British and Irish Governments aimed at securing widespread agreement between the two Governments and the relevant political parties on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of all-party negotiations.

Page 1, Agenda, 4. 
Both Governments, as signatories of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, reaffirm that they would be prepared to consider a new and more broadly based agreement, if that can be achieved through direct discussion and negotiation between all the parties concerned...

Page 2, Participation, 6. 
Negotiations will involve the participation, in the appropriate strands, of representatives of both Governments and all those political parties operating in Northern Ireland (hereafter referred to as ""the political parties"") which achieve representation through an elective process and which, as set out in the communique of 28 February 1996, establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process.

Page 2, Participation, 7. 
In the communique of 28 February, both Governments expressed the hope that all parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations. However, both Governments are also agreed that the resumption of Ministerial dialogue with Sinn Fein, and their participation in negotiations, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.

Page 2-3, Participation, 10. 
In their Communique of 28 February, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister said; ""They recognise that confidence building measures will be necessary. As one such measure, all participants would need to make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the International Body. They would also need to address, at that stage, its proposals on decommissioning. Confidence building would also require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.""";GBR;IRL;315;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The announcements made by the Irish Republican Army on 31 August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command on 13 October 1994 are a welcome response to the profound desire of people throughout these islands for a permanent end to the violence which caused such immense suffering and waste and served only to reinforce the barriers of fear and hatred, impeding the search for agreement.

Page 2, 7. 
In this Framework Document both Governments therefore describe a shared understanding reached between them on the parameters of a possible outcome to the Talks process, consistent with the Joint Declaration and the statement of 26 March 1991. Through this they hope to give impetus and direction to the process and to show that a fair and honourable accommodation can be envisaged across all the relationships, which would enable people to work constructively for their mutual benefit, without compromising the essential principles or the long-term aspirations or interests of either tradition or of either community.

Page 2, 9. 
The primary objective of both Governments in their approach to Northern Ireland is to promote and establish agreement among the people of the island of Ireland, building on the Joint Declaration. To this end they will both deploy their political resources with the aim of securing a new and comprehensive agreement involving the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland and commanding the widest possible support.

Page 2, 9. 
They take as guiding principles for their co-operation in search of this agreement: (i) the principle of self-determination, as set out in the Joint Declaration;...

Page 3, 12. 
...They will continue to work towards and encourage the achievement of agreement, so as to realise the goal set out in the statement of 26 March 1991 of ""a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands"".

Page 4, Constitutional Issues, 17. 
New arrangements should be in accordance with the commitments in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration. They should acknowledge that it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. If in future a majority of the people there wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, the two Governments will introduce and support legislation to give effect to that wish. 

Page 5, Constitutional Issues, 20.
...This new approach for Northern Ireland, based on the continuing willingness to accept the will of a majority of the people there, will be enshrined in British constitutional legislation embodying the principles and commitments in the Joint Declaration and this Framework Document, either by amendment of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation, and appropriate new provisions entrenched by agreement.

Page 11, East-West Structures, 42.
...The Conference will be the principal instrument for an intensification of the co-operation and partnership between both Governments, with particular reference to the principles contained in the Joint Declaration, in this Framework Document and in the new Agreement, on a wide range of issues concerned with Northern Ireland and with the
relations between the two parts of the island of Ireland. It will facilitate the promotion of lasting peace, stability, justice and reconciliation among the people of the island of Ireland and maintenance of effective security co-operation between the two Governments.";GBR;IRL;315;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;1;3;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

...We note that the Downing Street Declaration is not a solution, nor was it presented as such by its authors. A solution will only be found as a result of inclusive negotiations.

Dukana-Dillo-Maikona peace declaration was first support by the Kenya National Steering Committee (NSC) in 20009.  The declaration was a cross border solutions to the prolonged community conflict between Boranas of Ethiopia and Gabras of Kenya.  As a result of this declaration, the conflict was mitigated to a great extend enabling the two communities live together, share grazing and watering resources , opened cross border trade and enabled education and health services sharing especially on the Kenyan side.  However, with the introduction of a USAID funded program dabbed PEACE III, in partnership with Strategies for Northern Development (SND) and Inter African Group (AIG), the two communities identified the need to revise the declaration and its amendment due to the prevailing circumstances identified as inconsistencies, ambiguity and double punishment inflicted on suspect.  The parties, in one of PEACE III activities suggested the need to review some key clauses such as age specification of cattle that is used for blood compensation.  On May 31, 2017 at Koet-Borana Hotel Moyale- Ethiopia, PEACE III and its partners facilitated a community meeting that reviewed and mended the Dukana-Dillo-Maikona Declaration. This meeting gave forth the reviews and amendments on the Dukana-Dillo-Maikona declaration peace process which PEACE III helped document and is here presented for validation.

The Group noted such positive developments as the appointment of the members of the Interim Elections Commission and the ad hoc Supreme Court, the completion of reconnaissance visits by ECOMOG to the areas held by the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), and the opening of some of the trunk roads in Liberia. However, many other important aspects of the Yamoussoukro Accord had remained unimplemented, particularly those relating to the establishment of a buffer zone along the Sierra Leone-Liberia border, and the encampment and disarmament of all combatants.

Page 1, Outcome of Deliberations, Reaffirmation of the Yamoussoukro Accord, 4: The Group's discussion was characterised by a new spirit of constructive dialogue. The Group reaffirmed the validity of the Yamoussoukro Accord of 30 October 1991 as offering the best possible framework for a peaceful resolution of the Liberian conflict, for creating the necessary conditions of peace and security and the proper atmosphere that would conduct free, fair and democratic elections in Liberia. It therefore called on all the parties concerned, in particular the NPFL, to repose trust and confidence in ECOMOG and to co-operate fully with ECOMOG to ensure, without any further delay, the speedy, uninterrupted and effective implementation of the Accord.

Page 2, Outcome of Deliberations, Reaffirmation of the Yamoussoukro Accord, 5: The Group requested the parties to refrain from any act or omission that might be prejudicial to the implementation of the Accord; the meeting agreed to make the following clarifications:
...(c) That the encampment and disarmament of all combatants shall be carried out by ECOMOG as envisioned in the Yamoussoukro Accord.

Page 2, Outcome of Deliberations, Reaffirmation of the Yamoussoukro Accord, 6: In the light of the foregoing clarifications, the meeting directed the Field Commander of ECOMOG to implement the Yamoussoukro Accord without any further delay.

";"Page 1, OUTCOME OF DELIBERATIONS, Developments since the Committee's last meeting, 4: The Committee reviewed developments relating to the Liberian crisis since its last meeting in Yamoussoukro on 16 and 17 September 1991. The Committee noted with appreciation that since that meeting, the Republic of Senegal, in keeping with its promise to contribute troops to ECOMOG, had started deploying its troops to Liberia to join ECOMOG. It also noted with pleasure the fact that the parties, in consonance with the agreement reached in Yamoussoukro during the last meeting of the Committee of Five, had nominated a five-member Elections Commission for the organization and supervision of the elections to be held in Liberia, and a five-member ad hoc Supreme Court to adjudicate disputes that may arise from the electoral process, as provided for by the Liberian Constitution. The Committee urged the parties concerned to take all necessary action to ensure that the Interim Elections Commission begins its work without any further delay.

Page 2, OUTCOME OF DELIBERATIONS, Timetable for encampment and disarmament, 6: Recalling the earlier Yamoussoukro Accord of the parties to implement, under ECOMOG supervision, the encampment of their troops in designated locations and their disarmament, and the mandate given to ECOMOG, in liaison with the parties concerned, to work out the practical modalities for the implementation of that Accord, the Meeting considered and agreed a programme of implementation of these important elements of the cease-fire, which is annexed hereto (see enclosure below). This programme envisages the implementation within 60 days of all the modalities for the establishment of the necessary conditions of peace and security on the ground in order to reinforce the confidence of the parties as well as create a proper atmosphere conducive to the holding of free, fair and democratic elections in Liberia not later than six months from the date of this Meeting. The Committee therefore renewed its mandate to ECOMOG to ensure that the programme is smoothly and speedily implemented, in order to make it possible for democratic elections to be held in Liberia within the stipulated period. To this end, it appealed to all the parties concerned to continue to repose trust and confidence in ECOMOG and to cooperate fully with ECOMOG, the Interim Elections Commission, the INN and all other international observers who may wish to observe and monitor the electoral process.

Page 4, Enclosure, Programme of implementation, Tasks: It is clear that trust and confidence from all the parties to the conflict underpin the operations of ECOMOG which, in the light of the Yamoussoukro meetings, should now take us into the next phase. It is therefore recommended that this next phase commence on 15 November 1991, which shall be known as ""D"" Day.";LBR;;341;1062.0;860.0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0

";"Page 3, Endorsement of ECOWAS peace plan, 6: The Authority endorsed the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia as embodied in the Banjul communiqué and decisions of the Standing Mediation Committee adopted on 7 August 1990

Page 3, Endorsement of ECOWAS peace plan, 7: The Authority noted with satisfaction that the ECOWAS peace plan had received the widest acceptance and support from Liberians and the international community.

Page 3, Signing of the cease-fire agreement, 8: In giving practical effect to this ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia, the Authority stressed the urgent need for a comprehensive cease-fire to be observed by all the warring parties as a necessary condition for the return of peace and normalcy throughout the territory of Liberia. The Authority therefore warmly commended the two warring parties - the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL) - who had agreed to observe a cease-fire and had signed a cease-fire agreement at Banjul on 24 October 1990,

Page 3, Signing of the cease-fire agreement, 9: At the Extraordinary Session of the Authority at Bamako, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPLF) - the third party to the conflict in Liberia - expressed its readiness to join in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict. The Authority noted with pleasure the acceptance by the NPLF and the other warring parties not only of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia as embodied in the communique and decisions of 7 August 1990 of the Community Standing Mediation Committee, but also their declaration of a cease-fire, which shall come into effect immediately. The Authority urged that the details for the implementation of the cease-fire should be worked out as soon as possible. It expressed the sincere hope that this declaration of cease-fire would mark the complete cessation of all hostilities as the necessary foundation for the return of lasting peace, stability and political accommodation and reconciliation of Liberia.

Page 4, Collective responsibility for ECOMOG, 11: The Authority also considered the necessity for an agreement to be concluded between ECOWAS and the Interim Government of Liberia with respect to the status and operations of the Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia. To this end, the Authority mandated the Executive Secretary to sign an agreement with the Interim Government of Liberia after approval by the Chairman of the Authority.

Page 4, Agreement on interim governance of Liberia, 12: The Authority urgently invited the parties to the conflict in Liberia to enter into dialogue with a view to reaching a political accommodation for the governance of Liberia within the framework of the ECOWAS peace plan. The Authority requested the Standing Mediation Committee to continue its efforts in encouraging such an accommodation between the Liberian groups.

Page 4, Reaffirmation of the Protocol on Non-Aggression, 14. Recalling that it had itself fully recognized the necessity for maintaining the peace and security of the subregion early in the life of the Community through the Protocol on Non-Aggression adopted on 22 April 1978, and believing that the Liberian crisis has given that Protocol a fresh validity, the Authority decided to reaffirm the provisions of the Protocol on Non-Aggression and to urge all member States to adhere fully to their obligations under it. In particular, the Authority recalled the commitment by all member States to refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against any other member State. It further called on all member States to refrain from any action that might prejudice or undermine the smooth and speedy implementation of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia.";LBR;;341;;860.0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;1

On 9 April, 1995, in the rural “ejido” of San Miguel in Ocosingo Municipality, the federal government and EZLN began a process of dialogue and negotiation based on the desire of the parties to reach a peaceful, just and dignified solution to the conflict which began on 1 January 1994, within the framework of the Law on Dialogue, Accord and dignified Peacemaking in Chiapas, where the National Intermediation Commission (proceeding in a constant active and operational effort of neutralisation) is acting as mediator, and where the Accord and Peacemaking Commission (set up to collaborate, help and participate in the dialogue and negotiation) plays a supporting role.
In accordance with the principles adopted in the San Miguel Declaration, the parties have agreed:

I am pleased to report that peace talks between the Seven Party Alliance forming the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) led to the successful conclusion of an important agreement on 8 November 2006, which has now been  consolidated  by  a  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement,  signed  on 21 November 2006. Earlier this year, following receipt of the identical letters of 9 August 2006 from the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), I appointed Ian Martin as my Personal Representative to undertake consultations with all concerned parties in order to build on the common understanding that had emerged. The agreement of 8 November 2006 represents an important milestone outlining the next steps in the political process leading to free and fair elections for a Constituent Assembly in 2007. In that agreement, the parties have agreed on the basic arrangements for the cantonment of the combatants of the Maoist People’s Liberation Army and the storage of the arms and munitions of both sides. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement declares the commitment of the parties to transform the existing ceasefire into permanent peace.

The GRP Panel headed by Chairman Howard Q. Dee and the NDF Deelgation headed by Vice Chairperson for International Affairs Luis Jalandoni held talks from 10 to 14 June 1994 in Breukelen, The Netherlands. These talks were held to advance the peace negotiations pursuant to the Joint Declaration of the GRP and the NDF signed on September 1, 1992 in The Hague, The Netherlands (henceforth, The Hague Declaration).
... The GRP and the NDF reaffirmed their adherence to The Hague Declaration.

Page 2, II. ISSUES DISCUSSED,
5. The NDF asserts its integrity and shall consider it a violation of The Hague Declaration if the GRP enters into talks with any person or entity pretending to represent the NDF or any of its organizations.
The GRP asserts its prerogative to adopt its own policy in this matter and in so doing, does not consider it a violation of The Hague Declaration.

Page 2-3, II. ISSUES DISCUSSED,
6. The NDF asserts its vigorous objection to the adoption of Proclamation Nos. 347 and 348 as amended by Proclamation No. 377, on the ground that these proclamations violate the letter and spirit of The Hague Declaration, more particularly, paragraph 4 and paragraph 5b which mandate that the subject matter covered by the proclamations properly belong to the substantive agenda of the formal negotiations. Furthermore, such amnesty program, adopted while peace negotiations are being conducted, impinges upon the organizational integrity of the NDF.
The GRP Panel reasserts its firm position that the issuance of the aforesaid amnesty proclamations, without prejudice to any other amnesty that may result from peace negotiations, does not violate the letter and spirit of The Hague Declaration, including paragraph 4 and 5b therefof. The GRP takes the position that the said proclamations respond to expressed desires of former rebels for amnesty so that they may live normal lives in peace, and the need to strike an equitable balance through amnesty for agents of the state to promote a climate of national reconciliation.
7. The NDF asserts its objections to Executive Order No. 125 on the ground that it seeks to impose upon the peace negotiations the GRP Constitution as the framework for the peace talks and is in violation of The Hague Declaration.
The GRP Panel reaffirms its position that the GRP commitment to Constitutional process and the Rule of Law as enunciated in Executive Order No. 125 does not violate The Hague Declaration, nor does it mean that it will cite the GRP Constitution as a basis for rejecting what otherwise would be just and valid proposals for reforms in socieity. If it is shown in fact that certain provisions of the GRP Constitution hinder the attainment of genuine reforms, the GRP Panel is willing to recommend to GRP authorities amendments thereto. In this context, it is clear that GRP's adherence to Constitutional processes does not constitute the imposition of the GRP Constitution as framework for the peace talks.
8. Both sides recognize the need for further discussion on the provisions of The Hague Declaration that will lead to agreements in order to realize the objectives of The Hague Declaration.";PHL;;209;;790.0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

...The meeting comes against a backdrop of non-implementation of key provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), more especially the conduct of free and fair general elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan to either confirm unity of Sudan or opt for separation and holding of Abyei referendum on whether Abyei retains its special administrative status in the North or be part of Bahr el Ghazal. The meeting also comes as the simmering crisis in Darfur is intensifying. This underscores the need for extensive dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party with a view to addressing the national crisis Sudan currently faces.

Page 3, PREAMBLE 
...The aim is to ensure full implementation of all peace agreements and all constitutional arrangements prescribed in the Interim National Constitution (INC), 2005; including respect for human rights and the rule of law, political empowerment of women, conduct of free and fair elections, holding of referendum for the people of Southern Sudan and popular consultation for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States. The commitment to resolve the conflict in Darfur is duly emphasized.

Page 3, PREAMBLE 
...The Leadership Council met on September 26 to adopt the APPC’s agenda and to draw up a set of rules to govern proceedings. The general assembly met on September 27 and listened to keynote speech by the Chairman of SPLM and opening remarks by leaders of 28 political parties and 5 civil society organizations, in addition to an address by a delegation from the Peoples’ Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) of Eritrea. On September 28, the APPC set up 5 working committees to discuss key national issues, namely implementation of all peace agreements, democratic transformation, national reconciliation and healing, economic and social situation in addition to foreign policy.

Page 4, 1. DIALOGUE AND NATIONAL CONSENSUS 
1.1. The APPC maintains that the process of forging national consensus requires open dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party. The APPC in Juba is the first such process since the signing of all peace agreements, particularly the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). There is need to continue this free democratic dialogue among all national forces, civil society and women organizations.

... The recovery of democratic freedoms and, in particular, the approval via referendum of the Statute of Gernika, were two decisive events that brought about a radical change in the political situation in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country.

Page 1,
... Because the Statute of Gernika - itself the result of long and, at times, arduous negotiations, which eventually led to a genuine pact between the representatives of the Assembly of Basque Parliamentarians and those from the Constitutional Commission of the Spanish Parliament - is the focal point of the will of the majority of the Basques and the legal framework which Basque society, at a particular historical juncture, provided itself with to gain access to self-government and to regulate its peaceful coexistence. It therefore represents the legitimately endorsed expression of the will of the Basques and is also an unprecedented achievement in their contemporary history, despite the fact that it does not satisfy each and every one of the claims made by a number of different sectors representing the broad range of society’s interests.

Page 1,
... The text of the Statute also contains the mechanisms, duly endorsed by the democratic expression of the people’s will, required for its reform. Further, as an expression of the respect for and acknowledgement of the aspirations to self-government the Basques have held throughout their history, in an Additional Disposition, the Statute expressly reserves the rights to which the Basques might have been entitled to by virtue of their history. The Additional Disposition also states that the acceptance by the Basques of the present system of autonomy does not mean that they thereby relinquish their claim to have those rights updated, through the expression of their will at each moment and in accordance with the stipulations of the legal system.

Page 1-2,
... Thanks to the positive dispositions it contained and these reservations, together with the First Additional Disposition and the possibilities offered by Article 150.2 of the Spanish Constitution, the Basques accepted that the Statute of Gernika was a valid instrument for the gradual satisfaction of their aspirations and endorsed it by an ample majority.";ESP;;342;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

6- The recognition of the right to self-determination of all the citizens of Northern Ireland has involved an intensification of their democratic rights both in content (creating new formulas of sovereignty) and form (giving the citizens of Northern Ireland the final say). The political characteristics of the peace agreement include the idea that the negotiations have taken place not with the intention of winning the conflict, but of resolving this. All the political traditions existing on the island have been included and all the political projects have been afforded the same chance of success, without any limitation other than the backing of the democratic majority.
